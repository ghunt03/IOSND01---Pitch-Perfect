# IOSND01 Pitch Perfect App
## Overview
This project was built as part of the Udacity iOS Nanodegree and was my first attempt at writing an iOS app. This specifications for this project was to develop a iPhone app, which can record audio and playback the audio after applying different filters. The sound effects include:

- Slow
- Fast
- Chipmunk
- Darth Vader
- Reverb
- Echo

This app also needed to provide the end user with the ability to pause and resume the recording. 

The audio features are built using the AVAudioFoundation class.

##Instructions
###Running the App
The app can be downloaded through this repository. Once downloaded you can open the project by double clicking on the PitchPerfect.xcodeproj file. After the project has opened in xCode you can run the app through the simulator.
